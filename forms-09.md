## Why Forms ?
The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage
In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online. You will see forms
when registering as a member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists.

# JavaScript Events

HTML Events
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

With single quotes:

<element event='some JavaScript'>
With double quotes:

<element event="some JavaScript">
In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element:
  
##  What can JavaScript Do?
+ Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:

3- You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements

4- You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
