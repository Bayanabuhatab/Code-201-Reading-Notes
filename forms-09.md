## Why Forms ?
The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage
In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online. You will see forms
when registering as a member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists.
