# Tables in HTML

The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells.

The HTML tables are created using the <table> tag in which the tr tag is used to create table rows and td tag is used to create data cells. 
  
  The elements under <td> are regular and left aligned by default
  
  
  # Table Heading
  
Table heading can be defined using <th> tag. This tag will be put to replace <td> tag, which is used to represent actual data cell. Normally you will put your top row as table heading as shown below, otherwise you can use <th> element in any row. Headings, which are defined in <th> tag are centered and bold by default.
