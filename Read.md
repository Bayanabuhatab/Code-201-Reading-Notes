# Controlling sizes of imgees in css

## How do you change the size of an image in CSS?
we  can resize the image by specifying the width and height of an image. A common solution is to use the max-width: 100%; and height: auto;
so that large images do not exceed the width of their container. 
The max-width and max-height properties of CSS works better, but they are not supported in many browsers

## How can I make all images of different height and width the same via CSS?
