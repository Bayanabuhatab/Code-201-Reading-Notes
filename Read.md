# Controlling sizes of imgees in css

## How do you change the size of an image in CSS?
we  can resize the image by specifying the width and height of an image. A common solution is to use the max-width: 100%; and height: auto;
so that large images do not exceed the width of their container. 
The max-width and max-height properties of CSS works better, but they are not supported in many browsers

## How can I make all images of different height and width the same via CSS?
Where the <img> elements appear in the HTML, rather than using width and height attributes we can use these names as values for the class attribute. In the CSS, we add selectors for each of the class names, then use the CSS width and height properties to control the image dimensions.

# Background-image

The background-image property allows us to place an image behind any HTML element.

# Background-repeat property can have four values:

repeat
repeat-x : The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
repeat-y: The image is repeated vertically only.
no-repeat: The image is only shown once.
fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page.
scroll: The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.
# Background position

+ left top
+ left center
+ left bottom
+ center top
+ center center
+ center bottom
+ right top
+ right center
+ right bottom
The properties must be specified in the following order, but we can miss any value if we do not want to specify it :

1: background-color

2: background-image

3: background-repeat

4: background-attachment

5: background-position

CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box.

# Contrast of background images

If we want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.
