# list in HTML
## introduction 
**Lists are used to group together related pieces of information so they are clearly associated with each other and easy to read. In modern web development, lists are workhorse elements, frequently used for navigation as well as general content.
Lists are good from a structural point of view as they help create a well-structured, more accessible, easy-to-maintain document. They are also useful because they provide specialized elements to which you can attach CSS styles. Finally, semantically correct lists help visitors read your web site, and they simplify maintenance when your pages need to be updated.**


The three list types

There are three list types in HTML:

1. unordered list — used to group a set of related items in no particular order

2. ordered list — used to group a set of related items in a specific order

3. description list — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions

      Each list type has a specific purpose and meaning in a web page.
      
      
      Description lists (previously called definition lists, but renamed in HTML5) associate specific names and values within a list.
      Examples might be items in an ingredient list and their descriptions, article authors and brief bios, or competition winners and the years in which they won. 
      You can have as many name-value groups as you like, but there must be at least one name and at least one value in each pair.

      # Boxes 
      * All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.

The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content

**Explanation of the different parts:**

- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear

- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent

- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content

- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
- 
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

> The total width of an element should be calculated like this:

Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin

The total height of an element should be calculated like this:

Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin
