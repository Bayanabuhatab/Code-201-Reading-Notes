# Test in HTML
When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of thepage. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page

### We'll show some of them :

Whay we use it ?

CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure 

# Basic JavaScript Instructions

What is JavaScript?

JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:


# Decisions and Loops

oop statements are a category of control structure that allow a designer to specify repeating sequences of behavior in a circuit. There are three primary types of loops in VHDL: for loops, while loops, and infinite loops. VHDL also provides if–then–else and case statements to implement control structures.

4.11.1 For Loop
A for loop is a sequential statement that allows a designer to specify a fixed number of iterations in a behavioral design description. It is important to note that in VHDL, unlike other software programs, each iteration occurs concurrently, which means that the loop is “unrolled.” A for loop can be used only inside a sequential statement, such as a process statement, a function, or a procedure. The example in Figure 4.24 illustrates the form of a for statement. A for loop executes the sequential statement within its body each time the index of the loop changes its value within the range of the loop. The label of the for loop is optional; the user may choose not to include it
